# Building

## Requires GO Version 1.21 or higher
1. https://go.dev/doc/install

# Building the default marker pack from scratch
1. `go build`
1. `./gw2_markers_gen -n ShellshotMarkerPack`
1. copy build/ShellshotMarkerPack.zip to your blish/taco marker pack directory (Typically `C:\Users\{user}\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\markers`)

## Build your own marker pack
1. Build the package generator: `go build`
1. Create a marker pack directory `XXXMarkerPack`
1. Add your catagories directory. `XXXMarkerPack/categories`
1. Define categories using your directory structure. Example: `XXXMarkerPack/categories/Janthir/Chests` generates the Category: `Janthir.Chests`
1. Any edge category requiring configuration (including icons), may be defined using a `.cat` file instead
1. Add your maps directory. `XXXMarkerPack/maps`
1. Add a map you intend to add markers for: `XXXMarkerPack/maps/JanthirSyntri`
1. Create `mapinfo.txt` in your map directory containing the map id. EX: `id=1554` (Can be easily found using the "Marker Pack Assistant" module from blish)
1. Create any number of `.poi` and `.trail` files containing marker location information. (any sub directory structure may be used)
1. Generate your package zip file: `./gw2_markers_gen -n XXXMarkerPack`

### .cat file format

- Key/Value MUST be separated by the `=` sign
- All non Key/Value pair lines will be skipped

- Value pairs MUST be seperated by the space character
- Key/Value MUST be separated by the `=` sign
- Every marker line MUST contain X,Y,Z position information (as copied using the "Marker Pack Assistant" module from blish)
